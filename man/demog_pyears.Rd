}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{
    a formula object. 
    The response variable will be a vector of follow-up times 
    for each subject, or a \code{Surv} object containing the survival
    time and an event indicator. 
    The predictors consist of optional grouping variables 
    separated by + operators (exactly as in \code{survfit}),
    time-dependent grouping 
    variables such as age (specified with \code{tcut}), and optionally a 
    \code{ratetable} term. 
    This latter matches each subject to his/her expected cohort. 
  }

\item{data}{
    a data frame in which to interpret the variables named in 
    the \code{formula}, or in the \code{subset} and the \code{weights}
    argument. 
  }

\item{period}{Numeric vector defining calendar periods to stratify analysis, use \code{NULL} for no periods.}

\item{agegr}{Numeric vector defining ages \emph{in years} for splits.}

\item{cohort}{Numeric vector defining birth cohorts to stratify analysis, use \code{NULL} for no cohort stratification.}

\item{tips}{Break points for TIme Preceding Survey.}

\item{origin}{Origin year for date arguments. 1900 for CMC inputs.}

\item{scale}{
    a scaling for the results.  As most rate tables are in units/day, the 
    default value of 365.25 causes the output to be reported in years. 
  }

\item{dob}{Variable name for date of birth (character string).}

\item{intv}{Variable name for interview date (character string).}

\item{tstart}{Variable name for the start of follow up time, example is date
of birth. Default is 'tstart'.}

\item{tstop}{Variable name for the end of follow up time, examples include
interview date or date of death. Default is 'tend'.}

\item{event}{Variable name for the event indicator, example is
birth or death. Default is 'event'.}

\item{weights}{
    case weights. 
  }
}
\description{
This is a wrapper for the \code{\link[survival]{pyears}} function
in the \code{survival} package with convenient stratifications for
demographic analyses.
}
\details{
Note that \code{event} must be a binary variable per the internals
of the \code{\link[survival]{pyears}()} function. The function could
be updated to work around this stipulation.
