Description: This package includes tools for calculating demographic indicators from household
    survey data. Initially developed for for processing and analysis from Demographic and Health
    Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). The package provides tools to
    calculate standard child mortality, adult mortality, and fertility indicators stratified
    arbitrarily by age group, calendar period, pre-survey time periods, birth cohorts and
    other survey variables (e.g. residence, region, wealth status, education, etc.). Design-based
    standard errors and sample correlations are available for all indicators via Taylor
    linearisation or jackknife.
